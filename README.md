## Historical Context

This was a static website listing affordable lunch options (marmitas/quentinhas) in Rio de Janeiro, built with:
- Hyperion static site generator
- Nunjucks templates
- Stylus CSS
- Gulp build system

## New Direction

The project is being rebuilt as a **dynamic marketplace platform** where:
- **Marmiteiros** (food producers) can register, list daily offerings, and announce their location
- **Consumers** can discover nearby marmiteiros, follow favorites, and get real-time notifications
- **Mobile-first** approach with Expo (React Native) for iOS/Android/Web
- **Modern backend** with Rails 8 and real-time capabilities
